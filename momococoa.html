              They proposed the idea of launching a social media campaign, so I

          <p>To define the target market segment, I examined IBISWorld Cocoa &

                <li><strong>Quality ingredients</strong> such as low sugar and dark chocolate
                  cocoa in cocoa mixes are very important because the customers
                  are becoming more health conscious.</li>
                <li>Good <strong>variety of flavors</strong> to choose from helps in attracting
                  new customers and retaining the existing ones.</li>
                <li><strong>Affordable price</strong> point is necessary as many customers are on a
                  budget (such as students), so it is important to serve these
                  clients by offering low-price options.</li>
                <li>When a consumer is buying a product, it gets associated with
                  the brand as well. <strong>Good brand recognition</strong> is based on the practices
                  of the company and their ways of promotion of their products.
                  This also helps in building up the brand reputation.</li>

            </p>
            <p>I chose the Health-Conscious target market segment for my
              recommendation. These customers would buy cocoa mixes because of
              their health benefits. They will tend to choose products with more
              health-conscious ingredients, such as low sugar and dark chocolate
              cocoa, boosting revenue for the client. The Health-Conscious
              segment is expected to use the product 1-2 weekly and they value
              brands that focus on high quality ingredients. This segment has
              the ability to purchase the product due to their higher levels of
              income, they have a higher CLTV value ($216), and this segment is
              expected to grow in the future.

          My Solution: Influencer Marketing

          My suggested tactic recommendation is to collaborate with an
          Influencer that is famous for their healthy lifestyle and/or healthy
          food recipes. This strategy will allow for success because influencer
          marketing introduces customers from a trusted source in an authentic way.
          By partnering with health-conscious influencers, Momo Cocoa will be
          able to connect with the target market segment since they are already
          interested in the healthy lifestyle.

          <p>In order to test my research question, I examined the available
            surveys and papers on the topic of Influencer Marketing effects
            both in general product categories and in food marketing. The
            sources that I chose for my research are The rise of social
            media influencer marketing on lifestyle branding: A case study
            of Lucie Fink by Glucksman, M; and Endorsement and visual
            complexity in food advertising on Instagram by Kusumasondjaja, S. and Tjiptono, F.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">Discussion</p>
          <p>Social media influencers help create a certain image for the
            promoted brand that allows to build “direct relationships with its
            key consumers and encourages brand loyalty” (Glucksman, 2017). In
            the study by Glucksman, social media influencer marketing allowed
            to “break the wall between the consumer, the brand, and followers
            through social media content”. When seeing a trusted source use a
            product, customers feel more confident that they are making a more
            informed decision about a purchase. In case of food products,
            Instagram posts promoted by a famous influencer increase customers’
            purchase intention and pleasure (Kusumasondjaja, Tjiptono, 2019).
            However, not all types of posts are found to be equally effective
            in food advertising. According to Kusumasondjaja and Tjiptono,
            Instagram posts advertising food that are more visually complex
            generate more customer response than less complex advertising.

        <div class="section-desc">
          To measure the success of this project is the increased number of
          Instagram followers, starting at 500. This will take some time to
          reach the desired number of followers. By targeting the niche and
          engaged audience continuously, Momo Cocoa will be able to gain
          customers’ trust, more engagement with their content and increase
          the number of followers. The results will depend on the chosen
          influencer and the number of posts that the company is willing to sponsor.
